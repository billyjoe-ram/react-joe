# REACT-JOE

## About

React Joe it's the repository I created for saving and consulting my studies about ReactJS (Not React Native, only JS by now). I usually learn by YouTube videos, reading the docs and buying online courses.

This repository looks for always keeping the code clean and nice commented. If you have any suggestions, feel free to use it and open a PR!

Obs.: I am brazilian, so you might end up encountering some stuff in portuguese ;)
